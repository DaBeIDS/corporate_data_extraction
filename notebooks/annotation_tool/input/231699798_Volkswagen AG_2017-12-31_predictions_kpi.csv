It measures products’ CO₂ emissions along the entire value chain. It is calculated by dividing our CO₂ footprint by the number of vehicles produced. It thus incor porates both direct and indirect CO₂ emissions from the individual production sites (Scope 1 and 2), as well as all other CO₂ emissions occurring throughout the life cycle of the vehicles sold – from the extraction of raw materials through the use phase to the recycling of endoflife vehicles (Scope 3). The DCI thus makes it possible to pursue milestones in a transparent, holistic way as we make our way toward climatefriendly mobility. We are currently defining DCI target values for 2025, in consultation with the Volkswagen Group brands. The outcome should ensure that our target values contribute to the twodegree target set in the Paris Agreement concluded at the UN Climate Conference in December 2015.",Text,-5.022890567779541,17.421472549438477,2.4214725494384766

All our mobility concepts are tailored to the requirements and customer needs of our respective markets. By taking this approach, we will broaden our portfolio ofdrive systems such that traditional powertrains will coexist with electric mobility (emobility) systems in the future. Our current modular matrix platforms are designed so that different drive systems can be deployed in various combinations and flexibly fitted on production lines in manufacturing facilities around the world. In the future, we will focus on expanding our range of electric powertrains. We will also be adding an electrically powered version of our modu lar matrix (the Modular Electrification Toolkit or MEB) to form the backbone of upcoming electric vehicles. The MEB offers a number of significant advantages, especially in terms of packaging, meaning the arrangement of powertrain components, auxiliary systems and interior features.",Text,-6.629809379577637,17.231121063232422,2.231121063232422
